# bitlyurlcleaner
The purpose of this code is to take a list of shortened bit.ly or other redirected URLs, lengthen them, chop off any existing UTM codes and other query parameters to produce a clean URL, then append new UTM codes to it and re-shorten with bit.ly. The output is a CSV, pipe-delimited.
